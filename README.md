# flashcard-app-redux

## medium time commitment
- sorting by starred-ness (and maybe a whole new page? idk yet)

## small time commitment
- deleting entire decks (probably will live in edit-deck)
- deleting your account (the return of user-data? idk)
- fixing parser (\n\n\n for in between, tabs between front&back?)

## unknown time commitment
- adding appropriate comments to server, auth, and any new pages
- deployment, whatever that means
- importing my quizlet decks over!
